GradesHS
========

Tool for tracking your grades.


### Usage
Compile it or run `main :: IO()` from ghci.
It usually says what commands are possible.

Here's a short overview:

- list: Lists all subjects added so far
- mod:  Modify subjects
  - add:  Add new subject
  - res:  Add result to existing subject
  - rem:  Remove someting
    - sub:  Remove subject
    - res:  Remove result

### Planned:
- different averaging techniques.
- kinda international (at least modular) grade support
- advanced statistics.
- GUI
